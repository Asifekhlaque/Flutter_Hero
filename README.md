## What is Flutter?
Flutter is a framework for building mobile and web applications with a single codebase, making it easier for developers to create cross-platform apps.
## Native vs cross platform vs hybrid
- ### Native:
- Apps built specifically for one platform (iOS or Android) using platform-specific languages (Swift/Obj-C for iOS, Java/Kotlin for Android).
- Example: iOS app written in Swift or Objective-C, or Android app in Java or Kotlin.
- Pros: Optimal performance, native look and feel.
- Cons: Separate codebases for each platform.
- ## Cross-platform: 
- Apps developed to run on multiple platforms using a single codebase, often using frameworks like Flutter or React Native.
- Example: React Native (JavaScript), Xamarin (C#), or Flutter (Dart).
- Pros: Single codebase for multiple platforms, faster development.
- Cons: May not achieve the same performance as native apps.
- ### Hybrid:
- Apps combining web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with native elements. They run within a native container, like Cordova or PhoneGap, providing a balance between native and cross-platform development.
- Example: Ionic (HTML, CSS, JavaScript with a WebView), Apache Cordova.
- Pros: Web technologies for development, single codebase.
- Cons: Performance might be slower than native, reliance on WebView for some functionalities.
