## What is Flutter?

Flutter is a framework for building mobile and web applications with a single codebase, simplifying cross-platform app development.

## Native vs Cross-platform vs Hybrid

- **Native:**
  - Built for one platform (iOS/Android) with platform-specific languages.
  - Example: Swift/Obj-C for iOS, Java/Kotlin for Android.
  - Pros: Optimal performance, native look.
  - Cons: Separate codebases.

- **Cross-platform:**
  - Develops for multiple platforms using frameworks like Flutter or React Native.
  - Example: Flutter (Dart), React Native (JavaScript).
  - Pros: Single codebase, faster development.
  - Cons: Slightly lower performance.

- **Hybrid:**
  - Combines web tech with native elements.
  - Example: Ionic (HTML, CSS, JS), Apache Cordova.
  - Pros: Single codebase, web technologies.
  - Cons: Performance may lag, relies on WebView.
