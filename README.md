## What is Flutter?
Flutter is a framework for building mobile and web applications with a single codebase, making it easier for developers to create cross-platform apps.
## Native vs cross platform vs hybrid
- Native: Apps built specifically for one platform (iOS or Android) using platform-specific languages (Swift/Obj-C for iOS, Java/Kotlin for Android).
- Cross-platform: Apps developed to run on multiple platforms using a single codebase, often using frameworks like Flutter or React Native.
- Hybrid: Apps combining web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with native elements. They run within a native container, like Cordova or PhoneGap, providing a balance between native and cross-platform development.
